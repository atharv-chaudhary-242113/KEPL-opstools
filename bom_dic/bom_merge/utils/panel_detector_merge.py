"""
Reads row 1 of a worksheet from column G (PANEL_START_COL) onwards.
Returns an ordered list of (col_index, panel_name) tuples.
Stops at the first empty cell — the gap is intentional in this workbook:
it separates the panel columns from trailing summary columns (e.g.
'KEPL INTERNAL COST') which must not be treated as panels.
